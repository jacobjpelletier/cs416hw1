                <p>I have to say, I'm amazed. I've had these ingredients just sitting around for months and until now
                    I've never known a use for them! I made this sandwich a few days ago, but I am wondering what I
                    should do about the blisters on my hands due to the gloves. There were no instruction to take them
                    off afterwards so Iâ€™ve been spending my days wearing them, and it's becoming a little concerning.
                    I am also still a little confused as to why my brother didn't enjoy the sandwich, as it was not an
                    optional instruction, after telling him this he reminded me (rudely) that he has a peanut allergy.
                    Is it true that this would stop him from enjoying it? Anyway, I've been in the hospital with him for
                    a while now and I'm wondering if that instruction still applies? Should I show him the article? Do
                    you think that would make a difference? I did bring the sandwich with me in case, thanks in advance!
                    It also doesn't specify how the jelly should be applied, so I used my better judgment and used my
                    hand. Overall, I'd love if you went into more detail next time, maybe a few hundred steps to be sure.
