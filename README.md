### Objectives
The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiar with web page development and improve your
skills in the areas below:
	• Creating a web page using HTML
	• Using CSS to style a web page

### Assignment Checklist
The following is a checklist that you should refer to before submitting your assignment. This will prevent
you making mistakes that you would otherwise lose points.
• Make sure that the web page you submit includes the html, head, title, body, and doctype tags.
• Make sure that your HTML file is well formed, meaning all the html, head, title and body tags are
opened must be closed. For example, if you have <body> tag, you must have </body>.
o You should check your HTML code using “Nu Html Checker”

• Try to avoid redundancy in your CSS as much as possible. You should not have too many
redundant styles, if there are ways to use inheritance or special selectors to concisely define
style rules. Points will be deducted if styles used for this page are too redundant.
• File names (e.g., html file, images, ccs file) should be all lower-case with no space to separate
words, instead use - to separate words (e.g., recipe-styles.css).
• All the hyperlinks are working as expected.
• Make sure you follow the best HTML practices, which you can find under Lecture-2 on
Blackboard.
